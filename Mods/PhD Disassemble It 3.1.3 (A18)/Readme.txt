PhD Disassemble It - 3.1.3
This mod allows for the breaks down Ammo, Armor, Traps, Firearms, Mêlée weapons, and Mods to their base components. Just select the item in your inventory, pull up recipes and then create the corresponding bundle. Once created, just open the bundle. Once opened the component parts are added to your inventory. Simple. 

Most ammo can be converted in quantities of 10, 50, 250, or 1000 but does require a workbench. Now you can take all that ammo you don't use and break it down into raw materials so you can make ammo you do need. 

You can also take 100 rounds of ammo and make a Bundle.

Ever been frustrated that your inventory is full and you're only halfway through a POI. Now you can breakdown all the unwanted armor, traps, firearms, mêlée weapons, and mods you find along the way into raw material instead of letting them fill your inventory or having to leave them behind. 

I've done my best to test this mod but do to it's extensive nature I'm sure to have missed something. So if you find anything you thing is a mistake please let me know and I'll be happy to fix it.
